# Bakery Website - Claude Code Project Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack bakery management system built with Next.js, Material UI, and TypeScript in an Nx monorepo architecture.

**Architecture:**

- Frontend: Next.js 15 with App Router, Material UI, TypeScript
- Backend: TypeScript with domain-driven design (Express + Sequelize)
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
- State Management: React Context (Theme, Cart, Authentication)
- API Integration: bakeryAPI service with mock data fallback

**Deployment Targets:**

- Landing Page → GitHub Pages (static export)
- Shop System → Vercel (SSR for performance)
- Management System → Vercel (CSR for interactivity)
- Backend API → Google Cloud Run (containerized)

## Quick Commands

### Development

```bash
npm run dev                 # Start development server
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run test               # Run tests
npm run test:watch         # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Generate coverage report
npm run lint               # Run ESLint
```

### Nx Commands

```bash
# Development
nx serve bakery-shop       # Start shop application
nx serve bakery-management # Start management system
nx serve bakery-api        # Start TypeScript backend API (port 5000)
nx serve bakery-landing    # Start landing page (Next.js dev server)
npm run dev                # Start all applications

# Building
nx build bakery-shop       # Build shop app
nx next:build bakery-landing  # Build landing page with Nx dependencies
nx build-static-standalone bakery-landing  # Build landing page standalone (recommended)
nx affected:build          # Build only affected projects

# Static Export (Landing Page)
nx build-static-standalone bakery-landing  # Recommended: standalone static build
npm run build:landing:static               # Same as above
npm run build:landing:nx                   # Uses Nx dependencies (may fail)
nx build-static bakery-landing             # Full Nx build + export

# Testing & Quality
nx affected:test           # Test only affected projects
nx affected:lint           # Lint affected projects
nx format:write            # Format code
```

## Key Features

### Customer Experience

- Product browsing with category filtering
- Shopping cart with persistence
- Real-time inventory checking
- German localization throughout

### Admin Dashboard

- Order management with DataGrid
- Inventory tracking
- Production workflow management
- User authentication with JWT

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests alongside implementation
- Maintain >80% coverage
- Use React Testing Library best practices
- Run `npm test` before committing

## Development Workflow

1. Check current status: `git status`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Lint code: `npm run lint`
4. Build to verify: `npm run build`

## Important Notes

- **Landing Page**: `http://localhost:3000` (Next.js dev server)
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:5000` (Express/Node.js)
- **Shop**: `http://localhost:4200`
- **Management**: `http://localhost:4201`
- Always check existing patterns before implementing new features
- Follow existing code conventions and component structure
- German localization throughout customer-facing apps

## Task Management (MissionControl)

Tasks managed via `mc` CLI. Files in `.mc/tasks/` as markdown with YAML frontmatter.

Quick reference:

```bash
mc status              # Dashboard
mc task board          # Kanban board
mc task next           # Next actionable task
mc new task "Title"    # Create task
mc task move TASK-NNN in-progress  # Change status
mc mcp                 # Start MCP server (stdio)
```

## Static Landing Page Build & Deployment

### Building for Static Export

The landing page (`apps/bakery-landing/`) is configured for static export to GitHub Pages, Vercel, or any static hosting:

**Recommended Build Commands:**

```bash
# Clean stale cache first (required if dev server was running)
rm -rf apps/bakery-landing/.next

# Standalone build (always works, recommended)
NODE_ENV=production npx nx build-static-standalone bakery-landing

# Or via npm script
npm run build:landing:static
```

**Output Location:** `apps/bakery-landing/out/` (ready for deployment)

### Deployment Options

- **GitHub Pages**: Upload `out/` contents or use GitHub Actions workflow
- **Traditional Hosting**: Upload `out/` directory to web server

### Troubleshooting Static Builds

**Problem: Build fails with `<Html> should not be imported outside of pages/_document` or `Cannot find module for page`**

```bash
# Cause: Stale .next cache from dev server. Always clean before building.
rm -rf apps/bakery-landing/.next
NODE_ENV=production npx nx build-static-standalone bakery-landing
```

**Problem: Nx build fails with shared library TypeScript errors**

```bash
# Solution: Use standalone build that avoids problematic dependencies
npm run build:landing:static
```

**Problem: Module resolution errors for @bakery/\* imports**

```bash
# Solution: Ensure tsconfig extends the base configuration
# File: apps/bakery-landing/tsconfig.json should have:
# "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json"
```

**Problem: Cannot resolve shared library modules**

```bash
# Solution: Build required shared libraries first
nx build shared-utils
nx build shared-types
# Then try the landing page build again
```
